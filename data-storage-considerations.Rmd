## "Classifying data"

- [Penn State Data Categorization initiative](http://security.psu.edu/info-classification-decision-tool/)
- [Penn State AD-95](https://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD95.html)

## Where to store data "locally"

- Local computers
    - Encrypted hard drives or not
- University servers
    - Who manages access
    - Encryption or not (clinical/HIPAA-protected data or not)

## How to share data with colleagues on your protocol

- Not email
    - Emails are copied on each server they pass through
    - Password-protected files (e.g. Excel, Word)
- Flash/hard drives
- "Cloud" storage
    - Box, Dropbox, Amazon, Google
        - HIPAA compliance?
        - Is HIPAA compliance too strict?
    - Depends on institutional policies
- Institutional servers
    - Who grants access, etc.
    - Data "enclaves"
    - USB dongles with changing passwords
- Repositories
    - "Private"" projects on OSF, Databrary, Dataverse
