This document describes the range of models used in seeking permission or consent from research participants to share data.

Ways to secure permission to share
==================================

Implicit permission to share data embedded in research consent
--------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to state the conditions under which data will be shared in the research consent document, but not seek explicit permission to share via a participant's initials or signature.

### Example

> Your research records will be labeled with {*list all identifiers or data elements that apply*} {your code number, your date(s) of participation in the research,...} and will be stored {*describe safe area where research records are to be stored*} which may include electronic storage with a {University-approved} third party provider. A security breach (break in or cyber attack) might lead to someone being able to link you to your data. This risk is very low because your data are stored securely, and the information about your identity is stored separately from the other information can be linked only through a code.

> In addition, {selected parts of} your research records will be stored on {*describe site or sites where data will be shared*} in keeping with best practices of open and transparent scientific research. This means that {*describe who will have access*} will have access to your research records for {*describe how long records will be stored or "indefinitely"*}. This information will include {*describe which records will be shared*}. {*If not sharing information with personal identifiers*} The data we release to {the general public or other investigators} will, to the best of our knowledge, not contain information that can directly or easily identify you. We will remove or change information that could directly or easily identify you before files are shared. {*If sharing information with identifiers, specify which ones.*} The shared information includes {video recordings, audio recordings, photographs, your birthdate, your Census block group (neighborhood)}. {*If sharing identifiable data in a restricted repository*} The information that could be used to identify you will only be shared with researchers who have been given specific permission to access the data and who have promised not to identify {or contact} you. The research records from this study might be used for other, future research projects. Those future projects can focus on any topic that might be unrelated to the goals of this study. Once research records have been shared with {other investigators or the general public}, they cannot be withdrawn or recalled.

### Pros

-   Informs participants about the data that will be collected, how it will be stored and for how long.
-   Reduces the record-keeping burden required if some participants give consent to share and some do not

### Cons

-   Runs the risk that participants may balk at participating in research because of the, implied, requirement for data sharing.
-   Impliesp that the risks (and benefits) of research participation are equivalent to those of data sharing.

Explicit permission to share embedded in research consent
---------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to include requests for approval or permission to share data within the language of the consent to participate in research.

### Components

-   Language in consent form alerting participants that they will be asked about their permission to share data at a later point.
-   Separate sharing release/permission form that records participants' preferences.
-   Scripts for seeking sharing release/permission.

### Pros

-   Participants have one consent document to sign.
-   Participants give explicit permission to share by initialling or signing near or below sharing language.
-   Conditions of sharing (what data, with whom, stored/shared how, for how long, and for what purposes) can be described near and described similarly to descriptions of data storage provisions for the study itself.

### Cons

-   Makes consent forms longer.
-   May dissuade some participants from agreeing to participate in research.
-   Risk of sharing may or may not be equivalent to that of participating in research.
-   The researcher must keep track of participants who i) agree to research and data sharing, ii) agree to research but not data sharing, and iii) decline to participate in either.

Seek separate permission to share **after** the research session or study has been completed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pros

-   Participants have experienced the study and make make more informed judgments about any risks that might occur were the data shared.
-   Participants will be less likely to be confused about the relationship between research participation and data sharing.
-   Research participants may be less likely to decline to participate in research because of concerns about data sharing.
-   Research consent forms can be shorter and therefore pose less of a burden on participants to read and understand.
-   Some data repositories (e.g., [Databrary](http://databrary.org)) have created [template release language](https://www.databrary.org/access/policies/release-template.html) that can be adopted for post-participation sharing permission.

### Cons

-   A second document with identifiable information (signatures, or possibly names) must be collected, stored, and secured.

Seek permission to share retroactively (some time after the research has been concluded)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pros

### Cons

Seek permission to share via a separate protocol that is devoted only to data sharing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
