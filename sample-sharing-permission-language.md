Why share data and with whom
----------------------------

> *In keeping with best practices of open and transparent scientific research, {meet government and research funder requirements}, and to ensure that your participation has the maximum benefit to the public, we ask your permission to share some of the data you have provided with...*

### Sharing with the public

> *...the public on a web site that does not restrict access to information.*

### Sharing with researchers

> *...other researchers who must apply for access and who must promise to protect your information and your identity as carefully as the researchers involved in this study. Your information will be stored {on a web site} in a controlled database that restricts who can access your information.*

> *...The research team in charge of this study will decide which researchers can access your information. A committee of experts will carefully review every data request from other scientists before allowing them to use your information. These other investigators may be at <your institution> or at other research centers (academic or commercial) around the world.*

> *...Researchers who are granted access must sign an agreement stating that they will strictly maintain your confidentiality, and that the researchers have obtained approval from and are monitored by an Institutional Review or Research Ethics Board.*

OR

> *...The web site where your information will be stored in a controlled database limits access to researchers who have formal approval from their institutions. These other investigators may be at {your institution} or at other research centers (academic or commercial) around the world.*

> *...No researcher using shared information will contact you unless you have specifically agreed to be contacted again.*

Sharing what data
-----------------

### Personal identifiers

> *...Before sharing, we will remove information that may be used to identify you directly, such as your name, phone number, email address {other identifiers that were collected}.*

> *...Your data will be identified by code number, not by name.*

### Self-reported personal characteristics or health

> *...We will share other information such as your age, {birthdate}, ethnicity, education,...*

### Video or audio recordings

> *...We will only share {audio recordings, video recordings, photographs} after reviewing them and removing segments or portions that might cause you embarrassment or harm or might cause embarrassment or harm to bystanders who were not part of this research but were still {recorded, photographed}.*

> *...Please note that images and/or voices of people in the {audio recordings, video recordings, photographs} may be seen or heard. First and/or last names of people may be spoken aloud. If the study takes place in your home, aspects of your home may be seen or heard. In addition, other information may have been collected about you {, your child, or your family} in conjunction with this session. Thus, someone might be able to identify you, your child, or other people from the recordings. But researchers with access to the shared {audio recordings, video recordings, photographs} have agreed not to reveal the identities of anyone.*

Permission to show excerpts in public: Specific to [Databrary](http://databrary.org)

> *...If you agree to share your data, we also request permission to allow researchers to show selected {audio, video, or photographic} excerpts or images in public settings for informational or educational presentations Such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and those videos or recordings made available to the public via the internet (e.g., YouTube). You can agree to share your recordings and other data with researchers, but not give permission for researchers to show excerpts or images in public settings.*

### Brain imaging data

> *...Before sharing your brain scans, we will remove information that might permit someone to identify you.*

#### Discussion

-   Defacing
-   Header data "cleaning"
    - Scrub names
    -   Date/time of acquisition (embedded) means must be cautious about exact age or birthdates. May need to redact or change date/time of acquisition to prohibit re-identification.

### Diaries or interviews

> *...We will only share transcripts from the {diaries, interviews} we collected after reviewing them and removing information that might cause you or someone else harm.*

### Geographic data

> *...We will not share your home address or any other information about where you live.*

OR

> *...We will share the {Census Block Group, Census Tract, or County} where you live so that researchers can use other public data to understand the characteristics of your community.*

OR (if applicable)

> *...We will share the GPS positions recorded by the {describe how collected} but will "blur" the information so that your exact movements cannot be easily determined by others.*

#### Discussion

-   Not home address (without permission)
-   Not Census Block, [Census Block Group](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/gtc/gtc_bg.html) or Census Tract (without permission).
-   HIPAA prohibits sharing ZIP codes if population &lt; 20,000. How does a PI know this?

### Sensitive data elements

> *...We will NOT share information about {list sensitive data items collected that will not be shared}...*

OR

> *...We will share {list sensitive data items collected that will be shared}... However, the researchers who have access to these data must agree not to contact you, identify you, or otherwise cause you harm in conducting their research.*

#### Discussion

-   Information about potentially stigmatizing characteristics (situation-dependent)
    -   Religious/philosophical convictions
    -   Sexual identity and preferences
    -   Political affiliation, trade union membership
    -   Ethnicity, nationality, citizenship status

Sharing for how long
--------------------

> "...Your information will be stored for an indefinite period unless you specifically contact {study contact} and revoke permission. However, data and research results already shared with other investigators or the general public cannot be destroyed, withdrawn or recalled.\*

Sharing for what purposes
-------------------------

> *...The shared data from this study might be used to research any topic and might be unrelated to the goals of this study.*

> *...Shared data will be used only for research purposes.*

> *...National or state laws may require us to show information to university or government officials (or sponsors), who are responsible for monitoring the safety of research.*

> \*...In addition, researchers are required to report child abuse to law enforcement. If researchers come across information giving reasonable cause to believe that child abuse has taken place, confidentiality cannot be maintained.

> *...By agreeing to share data, you are making a free and generous gift that might help others. It is possible that some of the research conducted using your information eventually could lead to the development of new methods for studying {behavior, the brain, ...}, new diagnostic tests, new drugs, or other commercial products. Should this occur, there is no plan to provide you with any part of the profits generated from such products and you will not have any ownership rights in the products.*

Permission to share is separate from consent to participate
-----------------------------------------------------------

> *...Giving permission to share information is separate from consenting to participate in the research study. You do not have to give permission to share your information. Your choices will not affect receipt of payment if offered for participation in this or future studies.*
